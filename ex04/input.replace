I found a love for me

Darling, just dive right in

and follow my lead

Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet

Oh, I never knew you were

The someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids

When we fell in love

Not knowing what it was

I will not give you up this time

But darling, just kiss me slow

Your heart is all I own

And in your eyes you're holding mine
